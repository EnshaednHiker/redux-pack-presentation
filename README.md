# redux-pack presentation

## what this is

Hey Everybody! I gave a presentation at a React meetup in Minneapolis, MN on what redux-pack is and why they should consider using it. I used [slidebean](https://slidebean.com/) to make the slides, and, while it was quick to use and fun to add sweet, sweet GIFs to my presentation, it would seem that when exported to PowerPoint, those awesome animations don't come along for the ride.  So I'm using the slidebean's option to export the presentation in html and I'm hosting the presentation here.

Also, you should really consider [redux-pack](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/redux-pack) as an alternative or used in conjunction with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk). You can see how I implemented redux-pack into my [Context website](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context-webclient). Check out the presentation to learn more!
